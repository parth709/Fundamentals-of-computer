Why We Use Terminal in Linux

The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with the Linux operating system. 
It offers efficiency, allowing faster execution of commands than a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It provides control, giving you full access to system management. 
Lastly, it enables automation, allowing you to write scripts to automate tasks.
