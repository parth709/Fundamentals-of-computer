What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that performs three basic functions:

    Input: It receives data from you.
    Processing: It processes that data based on instructions.
    Output: It displays the final result.
    The person credited with inventing the first computer is Charles Babbage.

How a Computer Works
A computer follows a simple three-step cycle to do any task:

    You give it commands or data using input devices.
    The computer processes that information.
    It then shows you the result using an output device and can also store the data.

The Physical Parts (Hardware)
Hardware is any physical part of the computer that you can touch.

    Computer Case/Cabinet: The main box that holds all the internal components. It has buttons (like the power button) and ports (for USB, headphones, etc.) on the front and back.
    Monitor: This is the screen that shows you what the computer is doing. It's an output device.
    
    Keyboard: Used for typing letters, numbers, and commands. It's an input device.
    
    Mouse: Used to point, click, and navigate on the screen. It's an input device.
    UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply): A battery backup that keeps the computer on for a short time if the power goes out, preventing you from losing your work.
    
    Motherboard: The main circuit board inside the case that connects all the other parts together.

    CPU (Central Processing Unit): The "brain" of the computer that does all the calculations and processing.

    RAM (Random Access Memory): This is the computer's temporary memory. It holds information for programs you're currently using. When you turn off the computer, the data in RAM is gone.

    Hard Disk/HDD: This is the computer's permanent storage. It stores all your files, programs, and data even after you turn off the computer.

Hardware vs. Software

    Hardware are the physical parts you can touch (e.g., keyboard, mouse, monitor).

    Software are the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do (e.g., MS Word, Google Chrome, computer games).

Input vs. Output Devices

    Input devices are used to give information to the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, microphone).

    Output devices are used to get information from the computer (e.g., monitor, speakers, printer).

Memory: Primary vs. Secondary

    Primary Memory: The computer's main, fast, but temporary memory. The two main types are RAM and ROM.

    Secondary Memory: The computer's permanent, long-term storage. Examples include a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or a Solid-State Drive (SSD).
